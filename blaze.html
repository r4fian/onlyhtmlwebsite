    <Center> Blaze is a Vision Blocker ability that Phoenix must equip before casting. Upon casting, he will create a line of flames that moves forward along horizontal ground. The line of flames can be affected in two ways; it can be curved in a direction by holding the activation key and moving your crosshair in the direction you want the line to bend, and its length can be decreased by changing the angle you are looking in on cast. Looking straight ahead will cast the ability at max length, whilst looking directly up or down will cast the ability at minimum length.

        Once the line of flames has reached its target distance or collides with vertical terrain, a wall of flame will start to rise from Phoenix's location, spreading across the length of the line until it reaches maximum distance. Agents will begin to take damage as soon as the flame wall reaches an area they are standing on. The wall will always deal damage to agents at the same rate, but agents will take more total damage over the ability's full duration if they are closer to Phoenix's cast location compared to a player who was further away on cast. Once the wall reaches its maximum length, it will continue damaging any player it touches until it expires, at which point the whole wall will rapidly fall.
        
        Phoenix is affected by Heating Up if he comes into contact with the wall.</Center> <br><br><br>
