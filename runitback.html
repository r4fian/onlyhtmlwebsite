        Run it Back is a Sustain ability that Phoenix can instantly use. Upon doing so he will place a marker at his current location and his body will be outlined with flames.

If Phoenix would be killed during the ability's duration, or after the duration expires, Phoenix's body instead dissipates. He is then revived at the marker's location with full HP. Shields are also replenished but only up to the amount he had when the ability was cast. When reviving, Phoenix returns in the direction he was facing when he initially cast the ability. The respawn automatically reloads all of his weapons.
