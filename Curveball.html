   <hr>
   <center>Curveball is a Blind ability that Phoenix must equip before casting.
    Upon casting, he will throw a flare orb that detonates after a set amount of time. 
   Phoenix can use Primary and Alt Fire to control the direction the orb curves in; Primary Fire curves the orb to the left and Alt Fire curves the orb to the right.</center> <br><br><br>
