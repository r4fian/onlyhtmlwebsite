    <h2>Description</h2> <hr>
    <center> Hot Hands is a Deterrent ability that Phoenix must equip before casting. Upon casting he will throw a fireball that detonates as soon as it comes into contact with horizontal terrain. Phoenix can use Primary and Alt Fire to control the length of the throw; Primary Fire throws the fireball at long range whilst Alt Fire throws it at short range. Unlike most thrown projectiles that will naturally arc through the air when thrown until they hit terrain, Hot Hands has a set timer. If the fireball is still in the air after this time, it will immediately drop down vertically instead until it hits horizontal terrain.

        Upon detonation, the fireball will create a damaging zone that quickly spreads out from the point of detonation in a circular area of effect. Agents will begin to take damage as soon as the zone spreads to an area they are standing on. The zone will always deal damage to agents at the same rate, but agents will take more total damage over the ability's full duration if they were at the center of the zone on detonation compared to a player who was closer to the edge of the zone on detonation. Once the zone reaches its maximum radius, it will continue damaging any player it touches until it expires, at which point the whole zone will instantly dissipate.</center>
